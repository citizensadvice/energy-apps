%h2 If you pay more than one rate for your electricity

%p
  If you have a time-of-use tariff, you’ll pay more than one rate for your electricity. For example, the Economy 7 tariff has a more expensive peak rate during the day and a cheaper off-peak rate at night.

%p
  If you want to compare appliances on your off-peak rate, only tell us how much you use them when you pay the off-peak rate.

  %p
    You can tell us your rate on the next page. If you don’t tell us your rate, we’ll give you the results using the national average rate.
